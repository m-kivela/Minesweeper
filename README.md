# (Yet Another) Minesweeper!

This was a quick and simple programming project to get more familiar with python's object oriented programming and UI (tkinter) tools.

### Instructions:

Run the `gui.py` source file from the `src`-folder in python interpreter, i.e. open the terminal into the folder and type:

    python gui.py
or

    py gui.py

#### Note

Tkinter tools are not ideal for the way they're being used in this project. The game starts to slow down considerably with large game boards due to the way the buttons are implemented (this was the only way to get icons on the buttons).
